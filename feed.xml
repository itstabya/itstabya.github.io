My last trip was right before my move, with Chain Lakes in Washington, and I had always been privileged to go with more experienced backpackers and turn my brain off logistically. With this trip, I wanted to challenge myself with leading – especially with familiarizing myself with the nature in Northern California – and three of my lovely friends joined me for this easy overnighter.</p> <p>I’ve been impressed by the longer backpacking season available here, and I’ve noticed it’s also not as competitive as the PNW. We left San Francisco at 8 am, stopped for a quick coffee and Costco gas run, and made our way to the trailhead. The drive is around ~4 hours from the city, but it’s fairly entertaining; I would say half of the drive is along smaller roads, a little military base, and a very windy one-and-a-half way road. We drove by some bikers as well, and I was impressed because it was already a technical drive for me in my car!</p> <p>Parking was a pull-off right near the trailhead, and we had no issue at 1 pm when we arrived. We had a quick lunch by the car (thanks to versions of ourselves the night before, when we had hosted a potluck) and made our way on the hike.</p> <p>I forgot how tiring backpacking was – the hike details didn’t worry me too much, bu I definitely forgot that your pack is quite a few extra pounds! I had opted for my boots instead of my trail runners, and I suspect because I hadn’t worn them in a hot second, they gave me a few issues with blisters. Regardless, the first few miles of the ascent were extremely rewarding, with gorgeous views along Highway 1. The trail was a bit overgrown but not unmanageable. Lots of ups and downs, with minimal coverage in the beginning, but we found pockets of shade to take a few breaks and continue trudging along.</p> <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 14px;"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4404.JPG" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4404.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="test image" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4412.JPG" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4412.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4414-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4414-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4414-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4414.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>There were plenty of campsites at Kirk Creek, with the stream coming by, and we settled in for the night after a fun sampler of our four backpacking meals. There might have been an extremely chaotic game of UNO played in the dark with our headlamp.</p> <p>Overall, it was a lovely overnighter, and I couldn’t have asked for a smoother trip – no parking issues, plenty of campsites, beautiful views, and quality time spent with my wonderful friends. Plus, we may have snuck in a quick Boiling Crab on the way home when we passed San Jose!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="trip-reports"/><category term="fujifilm"/><category term="travel"/><category term="nature"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[getting the backpacking toes wet again]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">mexico city trip report</title><link href="https://itstabya.github.io/blog/2025/cdmx-trip-report/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="mexico city trip report"/><published>2025-05-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://itstabya.github.io/blog/2025/cdmx-trip-report</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://itstabya.github.io/blog/2025/cdmx-trip-report/"><![CDATA[<p>I had the privilege of visiting Mexico City over the long weekend – while we only had three full days, it was plenty time for some wonderful experiences, from local markets to impressive museums.
