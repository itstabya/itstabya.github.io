My last trip was right before my move, with Chain Lakes in Washington, and I had always been privileged to go with more experienced backpackers and turn my brain off logistically. With this trip, I wanted to challenge myself with leading – especially with familiarizing myself with the nature in Northern California – and three of my lovely friends joined me for this easy overnighter.</p> <p>I’ve been impressed by the longer backpacking season available here, and I’ve noticed it’s also not as competitive as the PNW. We left San Francisco at 8 am, stopped for a quick coffee and Costco gas run, and made our way to the trailhead. The drive is around ~4 hours from the city, but it’s fairly entertaining; I would say half of the drive is along smaller roads, a little military base, and a very windy one-and-a-half way road. We drove by some bikers as well, and I was impressed because it was already a technical drive for me in my car!</p> <p>Parking was a pull-off right near the trailhead, and we had no issue at 1 pm when we arrived. We had a quick lunch by the car (thanks to versions of ourselves the night before, when we had hosted a potluck) and made our way on the hike.</p> <p>I forgot how tiring backpacking was – the hike details didn’t worry me too much, bu I definitely forgot that your pack is quite a few extra pounds! I had opted for my boots instead of my trail runners, and I suspect because I hadn’t worn them in a hot second, they gave me a few issues with blisters. Regardless, the first few miles of the ascent were extremely rewarding, with gorgeous views along Highway 1. The trail was a bit overgrown but not unmanageable. Lots of ups and downs, with minimal coverage in the beginning, but we found pockets of shade to take a few breaks and continue trudging along.</p> <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 14px;"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4404.JPG" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4404.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="test image" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4412.JPG" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4412.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4414-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4414-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4414-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/trip-reports/bigsurbackpacking/DSCF4414.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>There were plenty of campsites at Kirk Creek, with the stream coming by, and we settled in for the night after a fun sampler of our four backpacking meals.

My first backpacking trip was actually a bit of a disaster, as it rained the entire time and I was soaked for much longer than one would like.</p> <p>Weirdly enough though, there’s a few facets of backpacking that have really charmed me, even with trips that don’t always turn out perfect. For one, it’s simply beautiful out there, and with all the screentime I probably log, nothing beats being able to experience life myself instead of through the manufactured experience of another. Backpacking reminds me that hard things are worth doing, that nothing is guaranteed, that nature doesn’t owe you anything – and you’re still able to experience an adventure of a lifetime. I’ve learned that I like getting away and that my biggest responsibilities are really quite simple – to survive and to enjoy my time. Life is stripped down to its simplest form, which I suspect is why people love and hate it.</p> <p>And, with all the fun I’ve had outside, it makes me so much more appreciative of my car, clean clothes, a warm shower, and my bed!</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/trip-reports/chainlakesbackpacking/DSCF2801-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/trip-reports/chainlakesbackpacking/DSCF2801-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/trip-reports/chainlakesbackpacking/DSCF2801-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/trip-reports/chainlakesbackpacking/DSCF2801.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="trip-reports"/><category term="fujifilm"/><category term="travel"/><category term="nature"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[a farewell seattle backpacking trip with the girls]]></summary></entry></feed>
