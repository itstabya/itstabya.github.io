## finding the right camera

My first big girl promotion and bonus came in August of 2023, a year after I had started working full-time, and I wanted to buy myself something nice to commemorate the milestone. I chewed on a few things, from a fancy purse to furniture upgrades, but I struggled with making such a big purchase for a materialist good. I did know that I had a big international trip coming up, with two weeks in Spain, and that my phone, while still functioning, perhaps wasn't the best camera to capture the upcoming adventure.

Growing up, I always enjoyed playing with my dad's cameras, but there were bulky and cumbersome to carry around. I spent a good amount of my early college days carrying a Polaroid camera around, and I treasure the box of Polaroid photos I have as a snapshot into my eighteen year old self, navigating college and life beyond home for the first time. I figured a camera would be a thoughtful investment for my twenties.

    One of my favorite photos, taken at the Chain Lakes Loop in the Mount Baker wilderness area. I love the reflection of the sky halo-ing a mom and her daughter, with the grandness of the lake behind them. This photo combines so much of my favorite themes: nature, scale, humans as proxy, a slice of life.
</div>

I ended up buying a Fujifilm XT30ii, after a bit of research online -- I've always wanted to shoot on film, but to be honest, I'm lazy and haven't crossed the activation energy to get into it properly. I'm a big fan of the film simulations -- I shoot on a Kodak Portra film simulation -- and I liked the option for interchangeable lenses. I did consider the overwhelmingly popular X100V, but the price felt right for the XT30ii (plus, I didn't want to commit to a fixed lens). The most significant complaints of the XT30ii seemed to be centered on size; it's a very petite camera, and folks with big hands have some trouble grasping it and will even resort to adding a frame on top. Not an issue in my book, more of a plus! At one point, I had gone into the rabbit hole of too many Fujifilm cameras and the technical specs of each, but realistically, my amateur approach frees me, in knowing that I don't know enough to care, or care enough to know.

I opted for the 18-55 mm kit lens, and it's come in handy for wider shots. A month before my Spain trip, my boyfriend managed the snag the elusive 27mm pancake lens, which folks raaave about as the perfect street photography set up. I love the pancake and shoot the majority of these photos on it, because having a light setup encourages me to bring the camera along. I'll still get overstimulated on trips where I have my camera and purse hanging on me, but all-in-all the setup is convenient and made even more fun with my hot pink strap!

I've been chewing on getting a wider lens -- the pancake can sometimes be a little too tight, but I think it's been helpful to push me in getting the right shot. 

## reflections on craft

Bringing my camera feels like journaling in live time -- I've noticed I am much more thoughtful in noticing things and keeping an eye out for "the shot." 

I think a lot about the notion of personal style and taste, in fashion, interior design, and more -- I respect the hell out of people who have taken the time to get to know themselves and live that version freely. On that note, over time, I've noticed I've developed the personal goal of articulating my photography style more clearly; I want to look at a photo and know that the artistic choices have been exercised the way I see the world.

A way of better knowing that is by evaluating my work at scale and seeing what patterns emerge. Hope you enjoy this mini collection of my favorite photos and that you see some themes yourself.

    This shot feels like a Where's Waldo adventure to me -- I took it at Tunnel Tops, the new(ish) park in the Presidio in San Francisco, where you get the most epic view of the bridge and there's just so many people enjoying the scenery.

### markets, color, flowers
We'll start small with a few photos from markets -- going to markets is one of my favorite parts of traveling. Pike Place Market in Seattle is one of my favorite places on Earth; while it's a major tourist destination, it has plenty of hidden gems of local life. I find the colors always to be a delight.

### perspective and scale

I love playing with perspective. I've noticed many of my shots are shot at a diagonal; I find shooting straight shots are a little too cookie-cutter for my liking (and I end up fiddling too much with the straightness of the shot), and I like that the diagonal shots feel like you're walking right on by.

Spanish architecture was out of this world, felt like it was timeless. I love snippets of urban planning in general, including this river pathway shot in Seoul right outside Gwangjang Market.

I also love working with scale, particularly with people as a proxy for size. I think figures bring a touch more interest into a photo and frame how grand of a scale we might be looking at. It's also so fun when there's a hidden Easter egg, like a little game of I-SPY.

    Outside of the Walker Museum, from a short trip to Minneapolis in the late summer.

I get to combine a ton of these themes in nature, and I've always just been so privileged to go to some incredible places. I never met a tree I didn't like.
