I had the privilege of visiting Mexico City over the long weekend -- while we only had three full days, it was plenty time for some wonderful experiences, from local markets to impressive museums. I understand why so many folks rave about Mexico City, especially from San Francisco; it truly packs the punch of a big international trip while only being five hours away.

We stayed in the Condesa neighborhood, and it was great walking proximity to many delicious spots and fun stores. I was impressed by the range of architecture in Mexico City -- some streets felt very similar to Barcelona, while others had sprawling buildings. Each neighborhood had its own distinct character, and I was a huge fan of all the greenery.

Our trip included a few landmarks, from the Museo Nacional de Antropología to Mercado Coyoacán. My favorite day was when we made it out to the Coyoacán neighborhood -- the food was delicious, and the Frida Kahlo Museum was pretty darn special. The park right next to the market had a little art fair going on, and there were plenty of locals just enjoying the day.
