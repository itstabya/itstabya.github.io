Currently a product manager at Microsoft, working on design and development patterns for the Azure Portal. Once upon a time, I built social features for Roblox and published in human-computer interaction.

I'm interested broadly in social media, online communities, systems of governance, and more. I also enjoy spending time outside, whether it's running, hiking, skiing, biking, or generally exploring. I'm a big fan of textile crafts, art museums, seasonal produce, and fun jackets.

In real life, I am usually in San Francisco. You can find me elsewhere on the Internet, at my [X](https://x.com/itstabya) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yangtanya125/).
