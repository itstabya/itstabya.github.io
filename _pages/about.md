Currently a product manager at Microsoft, working on design and development patterns for the Azure Portal. Previously, I built social features for Roblox and published in human-computer interaction.

I'm interested broadly in social media, online communities, systems of governance, and more. I also enjoy spending time outside, whether it's running, hiking, skiing, biking, or generally exploring.
